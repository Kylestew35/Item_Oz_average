I built this simple program that can be used in vscode(python) it asks for an item name, cost of item, and ounces.  
Then when the command done is input, it gives you total price of all items and price per ounce.  
This program is easy to use, can be scaled up, and solves a simple real world problem.

Use as you wish. Happy coding!!!
